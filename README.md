# Portfolio site

Portfolio site was built as part of the **Build a portfolio site project** in Udacity's Full Stack developer course. It is created utilizing Html, CSS and Bootstrap framework. It shows my basic information, my featured works and how to contact me. Enjoy!

# Documentation

Please refer to the documentation for the HTML files [@bootstrap-prestructure.html](https://github.com/metsehaf/Portfolio-site/blob/master/bootstrap-prestructure.html). There is an external stylesheet [@style.css](https://github.com/metsehaf/Portfolio-site/blob/master/style.css) and a bootstrap css [@bootsrap.min.css](https://github.com/metsehaf/Portfolio-site/blob/master/bootstrap.min.css), which is a minified CSS. The **Bootstrap framework** was utilized to take advantage of its robust grid based layout. In addition four images used in the website are included. The site also works in different device because it had a responsive layout. 

# Installation
